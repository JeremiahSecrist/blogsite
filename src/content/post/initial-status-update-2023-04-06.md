Over the past month, I've had a realization that has fundamentally shifted my approach to goal-setting. It's no longer enough to simply have a vague idea of what you want to achieve; as an individual, it's important to break down your goals into manageable, bite-sized pieces. For instance, take my goal to move: if I don't take concrete steps to achieve it, the goal is essentially meaningless.

In an effort to practice what I preach, I've been applying this principle to my own life. I've identified a desire to learn more, and to do so, I know I need to read more. Unfortunately, I've never been particularly disciplined about reading in the past - until this month, that is. So what's changed? It all comes down to motivation. For a long time, I was content to tell myself that things would magically improve after I finished college. But as that end date draws closer, I'm realizing that I've been squandering my time. So I decided It is finally time I do something about myself. I started paying closer attention to my habits and planing out ways to mitigate simple problems that result in large uncontrollable issues.

Despite my best efforts to improve myself, I recognize that I'm at risk of failing in these early stages if I don't hold myself accountable. That's where this blog comes in - it's a way for me to stay on track and hold myself to the standards I've set for myself. At the end of the day, it's up to me and me alone to keep myself in check as time goes on.

For anyone reading this post I would like to recommend two books that may aid in the way you think about the world. These books have certainly been helping me, and I am still in the progress of finishing them.

1. [﻿﻿Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career](https://www.amazon.com/Ultralearning-Master-Outsmart-Competition-Accelerate/dp/006285268X) \
   This book covers common tactics that help solidify your learning experience. One can not change what they do not know.
2. [﻿How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching](https://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Principles/dp/0470484101)\
   This book covers many similar ideas but views them from the lens of a professor. I find it a great addendum to the first.
